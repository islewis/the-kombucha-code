# 1st Fermentation
Once you have a scoby (Look here if you don't), you're ready to start brewing. The first step of this process is aptly named 1st fermentation, or 1F. Fermentation acts as a tool to achieve two things: Primarily, it add's a tangy, slighly sour body to your brew. Secondarily, when your scoby feeds on the sugar, it produces carbonation- thats how kombucha gets it's bubbles. 

1F is aimed to take advantage of the fermentation flavor, while ignoring the carbonation it provides. Giving your scoby sugary tea gives the healthy bacteria have something to feed on, which leads to fermentation. Letting this step happen without an airtight jar allows the carbonation to escape. Don't worry though, in 2F our drinks will carbonate. 

### ingredients

When preparing ingredients for a 1F, I start by deciding how many bottles of kombucha i'd like it to produce. This might be decided by how fast im drinking, or maybe just how many empty bottles I have on hand. The following ratios help address variable batch size, allowing you to customize the recipe to your needs. If this is your first brew, id recommend skipping to ###, which has a more concrete recipe to work with.  

#### Scalable Batch Ratios
Start by defining how large you want your batch to be. For an imaginary 1 gallon container, the target would be 16 cups. 

- Water: 85% volume of your target. For a target of 16, you would need (16 * .85 = 13.6) cups of water.  
- Kombucha starter: 15% volume of target. For our example of 16 cups, you should use (16cups x .15 = 2.4cups) about 2.5 cups of previous 1F kombucha. If this is your 1st batch, use the tea you've grown your scoby in.
- Sugar: 6.5% volume of the target. For 16 cups, you should use (16cups x .065 = 1.04cups) just about a cup of sugar. 
- Tea Bags: For every 2 cups of the target, use 1 tea bag. Per our example, 16 / 2 = 8(teabags). Don't worry if it doesn't devide out perfectly.
- 1 Scoby

We're in a kitchen, not a rocket lab. If the ratio calls for 1.3 cups, round up OR down- it'll be alright. 

You might have noticed that these rations add to above 100%. This accounts for evaporation, spillage, and other losses. If you end up with a tad extra tea at the end, drink it!

#### Simple batch measurements

- Water: 14 Cups
- Kombucha starter: 2 Cup
- Sugar: 1 Cup
- Black tea bags: 8 
- 1 Scoby

### Instructions
1. Add 3 cups of water to a pot, and bring to a boil.
2. Once boiling, add in sugar. Mix until sugar is desolved, and take of heat. Add your teabags, letting steep for 15-20min.
2. Remove the teabags, and add the rest of the water to the pot.
3. If your tea is still hot, wait until it has cooled off. Once it is room tempature, add tea to your glass jar, in addition to your storebought kombucha.
4. Add your scoby to the jar. Be sure to handle any scoby carefully. If using your hands to move it, throughly wash your hands before.
5. Cover the top of your jar with your cloth, and secure using a rubberband. This allows airflow, but prevents bugs from getting in.
6. Move out of direct sunlight and let ferment. Warmer tempatures and stronger scoby will speed up fermentation, while colder tempatures will slow it down. How long you go depends on how much "funk" you like in your kombucha. I aim for around 10 days, but feel free to go longer or shorter based on your enviornment and taste preferences.
