# Creating a Scoby
Kombucha at it's simplest is fermented tea. Often times when making or buying kombucha, other flavors such as fruit and spices are added. These add-ons make Kombucha taste better, but are completely optional. What isn't optional however, is the Scoby. Scoby stands for Symbiotic Colony Of Bacteria and Yeast, and is the workhorse behind kombucha's fermentation. It acts in a similar role to a starter for sourdough, and will live across many batches if you treat it right.  

While many think of the Scoby as the slimy looking layer that forms on a batch of kombucha, the liquid that it's fermenting in has the exact same bacteria as well! Kombucha purists differentiate by calling the residue layer the "pelicule", and using the term scoby to refer to anything containing the friendly bacteria (the residue and the liquid). However, many will call the layer the "scoby". Call it whatever you want, as long as we have a healthy brew it doesnt matter. 

Every batch of kombucha starts with a bit of the previous batch. This, along with the pelicule, seeds the new batch with the healthy bacteria we want. This kickstarts the fermentation, and speeds up the timeline of a brew. While this step is easy once you've brewed a batch, for your first time you need to bootstrap a scoby.
 
### Using storebought kombucha

Using existing kombucha is a great way to bootstrap. When searching for it, make sure to buy a kombucha that is raw/organic, something like [GT's "Pure" flavor](https://gtslivingfoods.com/products/gts-synergy-kombucha-pure). Your normal store kombucha is pasteurized, which harms bacteria growth.

Once you've found a good kombucha to use, all creating your new scoby takes is a bit of time.

### Ingredients
- Glass jar
- Cheesecloth or papertowls
- Rubberband or twine

- Water [7 Cups]
- Sugar [1/2 Cup]
- Black tea bags [4, regular sized]
- Raw/organic kombucha [1 Cup]

### Instructions
1. Add water to a pot, and bring to a boil. Add sugar, and remove from the heat. Once all the sugar is desolved, add your teabags, letting steep for ~30min. 
2. If your tea is still hot, wait until it has cooled off. Once it is room tempature, add tea to your glass jar, in addition to your storebought kombucha.
3. Cover the top of your jar with your cloth and a rubberband. This allows airflow, but prevents bugs from getting in.
4. Move out of direct sunlight and wait. Depending on the tempature, and the kombucha you used, this step could take anywhere from a week to a month. 
5. Once your pelicule is ~1/2cm thick, you're ready to brew! If it's a bit thinner, thats ok! It might add some additional time to your next ferment, but it will still work. 

### What's next
Now that your tea and pelicule are filled with the bacteria we want, we're ready to brew. We can use this to start our 1st fermentation (1F), which you can find more information about here.
