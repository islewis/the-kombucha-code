# The Kombucha Code

The Kombucha Code is a living body of Kombucha knowledge, inspired by [the-bread-code](https://github.com/hendricius/the-bread-code). Included are recipes, photo documentation, and answers to frequently asked questions. 

# Why Git?
Any of the recipes in this repo are:
- Accessible, via your preferred git browser, as well as the web.
- Forkable, for ease of recipe modification.
- Version Controlled. Something written recipes inherently miss is the record of recipe evolution.
- Digital. Ever lost something you've written down?
