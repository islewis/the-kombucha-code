# Pickle Juice
An extremely polarizing flavor that should taste exactly how it sounds. The target for this recipe is a similar flavor to pickle beers, and it uses leftover pickle juice. If brewed correctly, it should be salty and refreshing, but not sweet. This is a hard one to nail, and this recipe is still a WIP.

### Ingredients
Ingredient count is for a single 16oz bottle. Scale to meet your needs.

* Pickle Juice, dill [2 Tbs]
* English cucumber, peeled [1/2 Cucumber]
* Sugar [2 tsp] 
* 1F Black Tea Kombucha [~16oz]

### Instructions

#### Bottling

1. Peel your cucumber, and roughly chop it. Add to blender with a splash of water, and blend until smooth. Alternatively, if blending isn't an option, finely dice the peeled cucumber.  

2. Add pickle juice, cucumber mix, and sugar to bottles. 

3. Top off with your 1F kombucha. Flip your bottle a few times until the sugar is desolved.

#### 2nd Fermentation

4. Set aside the bottles and let them ferment. Make sure they are out of direct sunlight.

7. Wait for 7-10 days. This step is especially tricky for this flavor. We need the sugar to be added in order for the drink to carbonate, but if sugar remains and the drink is sweet, it's undrinkable. This step should take longer than other flavor's 2F, as it needs enough time for all the sugar to get eaten up.  

8. Drink! With the cucumber mash, the end result is super pulpy. I would recommend straining.

### Notes 
The 1st brew was too sweet after a 5/6 day 2F, making it taste like a bread and butter pickle (gross). After sitting 2+ weeks in the fridge, it continued to ferment, and ended up with a really nice, salty/sour flavor. Need to continue messing with 2F times to get that flavor right after 2F.
