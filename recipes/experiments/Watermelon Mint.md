### Ingredients
Ingredient count is for a single 16oz bottle. Scale to meet your needs.

* Watermelon Juice [6 Tbs, roughly a slice's worth of juice]
* Lime juice [1 small lime]
* Salt [1/4 tsp]
* Mint [To taste]
* 1F Kombucha [~16oz]

### Instructions

#### Watermelon Juice

1. Take your watermelon, removing the rind if still on, and add to blender. Add a small amount of mint.

2. Blend, adding water if needed. The goal is to taste the mint, but for it to not overpower. Add more mint if needed, and blend again. Repeat until level of mint flavor is as desired. 

4. Take the blended juice, and filter it through cheesecloth/ fine mesh strainer. This step can be skipped, especially if you plan on filtering before drinking, but watermelon has lots of pulp that can be unpleasant to drink. 

#### 2nd Fermentation

5. Add 6Tbs of watermelon juice mix to each bottle.

6. Add juice of 1 lime to the bottle.

7. Add juice of 1 lime to the bottle.

8. Top off with 1F Kombucha. Set aside the bottles and let them ferment. Make sure they are out of direct sunlight.

9. Wait for 3-7 days. The longer you ferment, the more body/kombucha funk your drinks will get. There are many variables that can affect this step. Tempature, watermelon sweetness, and 1st ferment length was all have an effect here, so it's hard to make a firm recommendation for length. Use your previous batches as a baseline, or even set aside a bottle as a "taster" bottle.

10. Drink! If looking for a smooth drink, filter again while pouring.

### Notes 

* It's really hard to measure watermelon. 6Tbs of juice is not a lot, one medium sized watermlon will give you many times what we need. I estimate a slice, but id recommend airing on the side of "more", and just drinking the leftover juice.
