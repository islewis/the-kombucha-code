### Ingredients
Ingredient count is for a single 16oz bottle. Scale to meet your needs.

* Canned pumpkin puree [5 Tsp]
* Sugar [1 1/2 tsp]
* Cinnamon [1/4 tsp]
* Nutmeg [1/4 tsp]
* Ground ginger [1 tsp, ~1g]
* 1F Black Tea Kombucha [~16oz]

### Instructions

#### Bottling

1. Peel your ginger, and grate as much as you need

2. Add grated ginger, spices, and pumpkin into bottles.

3. Top off with your 1F kombucha. Flip your bottle a few times until ginger and spices are distrubted evenly. 

#### 2nd Fermentation

4. Set aside the bottles and let them ferment. Make sure they are out of direct sunlight.

7. Wait for 3-7 days. The longer you ferment, the more body/kombucha funk your drinks will get.

### Notes 
The pumpkin puree I used had no added sugar, with about 4g sugar per 1/2 cup. It tasted a little bitter, so I added sugar.
