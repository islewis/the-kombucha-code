# Experiments
The `recipes/experiments` directory is used to hold unpolished recipies that are in still development. These experiments have enough potential to write down, but are not polished enough to recommend to new brewers. Other brewers might gain some inspiration by looking at them, but the end product might not be amazing yet.
