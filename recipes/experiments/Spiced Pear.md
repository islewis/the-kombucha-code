### Ingredients
Ingredient count is for a single 16oz bottle. Scale to meet your needs.

* Pear juice [4 Tbs]
* Cinnamon [1/4 tsp]
* Ground ginger [1 tsp, ~1g]
* 1F Black Tea Kombucha [~16oz]

### Instructions

#### Bottling

1. Peel your ginger, and grate as much as you need

2. Add grated ginger, Cinnamon, and pear juice into bottles.

3. Top off with your 1F kombucha. Flip your bottle a few times until ginger and spices are distrubted evenly. 

#### 2nd Fermentation

4. Set aside the bottles and let them ferment. Make sure they are out of direct sunlight.

7. Wait for 3-7 days. The longer you ferment, the more body/kombucha funk your drinks will get.

### Notes 
[1st brew](https://github.com/islewis/the-kombucha-code/commit/c0e4f88d76cfadbd53bfb451a2ff7b43b6398d7f) was delicious, and very enjoyable. Was missing a tiny bit of flavor depth, I'd like to try adding a bit of nutmeg or possibly allspice.
