### Ingredients
Ingredient count is for a single 16oz bottle. Scale to meet your needs.

* Pitted cherries [1/3 Cup]
* Lime juice [1/2 a small lime]
* 1F Kombucha [~16oz]

### Instructions

#### Making the cherry mix

1. If using frozen cherries, pull them out of the freezer to start thawing. The warmer they are, the better they blend. 

2. Add pitted cherries to a blender. Juice limes into the blender, catching any seeds. Add just enough water to blend. If cherries are still frozen, it will take more water- This isn't an issue. 

4. Blend until all the cherries are completely broken up, and the mixture is homogenous.

#### 2nd Fermentation

5. Distribute cherry mix evenly between all bottles. If doing lots of bottles, or bottles of different sizes (a 16oz, a 32oz, etc) I recommend divvying by weight. Weigh your total cherry mix, and then portion based on how many bottles you are making. Just make sure the larger bottles get their correct ratio (eg. a 32oz bottle should get twice the cherry mix than a 16oz) 

6. Set aside the bottles and let them ferment. Make sure they are out of direct sunlight.

7. Wait for 3-7 days. The longer you ferment, the more body/kombucha funk your drinks will get. There are many variables that can affect this step. Tempature, cherry type, and 1st ferment length was all have an effect here, so it's hard to make a firm recommendation for length. Use your previous batches as a baseline, or even set aside a bottle as a "taster" bottle.

8. Drink! The cherry pulp tends to clumb with the growing scoby, which isn't amazing to drink. I'd recommend straining to drink.

### Notes 

* Tastes great served with more lime! Squeeze and drop in a lime wedge if thats your thing.

* The end product can vary a lot depending on the cherries you use. I'm using homegrown cherries, which could have differing amounts of sugar from storebought cherries. If your having trouble getting carbonation, up the cherry content, or add a bit of sugar. If you have exploding bottles, either shorten the 2F or drop the cherry content.
