# Blueberry Ginger
A very fruity, and slightly spicy flavor that's super easy to make. Ginger complements the blueberry perfectly, and the end result comes out as a beautiful purple drink. Can easily be made with either fresh or frozen blueberries.

### Ingredients
Ingredient count is for a single 16oz bottle. Scale to meet your needs.

* Blueberries [1/4 Cup, 35g]
* Grated ginger [1Tbs very loosely packed, 4g]
* 1F Kombucha [~16oz]
* Lemon juice [1/4 of a lemon]

### Instructions

#### Making the Blueberry mix

1. If using frozen blueberries, pull them out of the freezer to start thawing. The warmer they are, the better they blend. 

2. Peel your ginger, and grate as much as you need

3. Add blueberries and grated ginger to a blender. Juice lemons into the blender, catching any seeds. Add enough water to blend. If blueberries are still frozen, it will take more water- This isn't an issue. 

4. Blend until all the blueberries are completely broken up, and the mixture is homogenous.

#### 2nd Fermentation

5. Distribute blueberry mix evenly between all bottles. If doing lots of bottles, or bottles of different sizes (a 16oz, a 32oz, etc) I recommend divvying by weight. Weigh your total blueberry mix, and then portion based on how many bottles you are making. Just make sure the larger bottles get their correct ratio (eg. a 32oz bottle should get twice the blueberry mix than a 16oz) 

6. Set aside the bottles and let them ferment. Make sure they are out of direct sunlight.

7. Wait for 3-7 days. The longer you ferment, the more body/kombucha funk your drinks will get. There are many variables that can affect this step. Tempature, blueberry sugar content, and 1st ferment length was all have an effect here, so it's hard to make a firm recommendation for length. Use your previous batches as a baseline, or even set aside a bottle as a "taster" bottle.

8. Drink! The blueberry pulp tends to clumb with the growing scoby, which isn't amazing to drink. I'd recommend straining to drink.

### Notes 

* This recipe can produce varying result based on the blueberries you use. If both 1F and 2F were long enough, and your drink is still not carbonated enough, try adding some sugar to the next batch. 

* Ginger content is easy to change. Adjust ginger content to your preference.

* If adding more blueberries, know it will add more sugar to 2F. This will give the scoby more to eat, which means more carbonation. This may or may not be desired. 

* Lemon juice can be omitted, but really balances out the flavor nicely.
